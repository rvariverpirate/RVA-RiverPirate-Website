<h3>
  Interfacing a PIC32 (NU32) with a SSD11306 OLED screen to display an image.
</h3>
<p>
The OLED display used in this project uses i2c communication to receive serial data that determines which pixels to turn on or off. By converting an image to the appropriate format (a hex map) which we can then use to display an image on the screen.

<h3>
Part 1: Code Dependencies
</h3>
<p>
	As much as I'd like to take credit for all of the code used in this project the foundation of this code was built on an example from "Embedded Computing and Mechantonics with the PIC32 Microcontroller" (a great guide for PIC32's). The entire source code is available on my GitHub page. Because I'm not reinventing the wheel this page will focus on getting an image to the screen.

<h3>
Part 2: Displaying the Image
</h3>
<p>In the GitHub project directory (OLED-Experiments/i2c_bitmaps) look for 'i2c_bitmaps.c'. This is the main file for this project. You'll notice a large char array at the beginning of main. This is the hex mapped version of the image shown below. Don't worry you wont have to type this manually to change the image I'll describe generating the hex map shortly.</p>

<p>Within the while statement notice this section.</p>
<prism-block [code]="'    for(i = 0; i < sizeof(imageHex); i++){
      for(j = 7; 0 <= j; j--){
        if((imageHex[i] >> j) & 0x01){
          display_pixel_set(row, col, 1);
        }
        col++;
        if(col >= WIDTH){
          row++;
          col = 0;
        }
      }
    }
    display_draw();'" [language]="'c'"></prism-block>
<p>Note that display_pixel_set(row, col, 1) simply determines if a pixel at a given row and column is illuminated (1) or not (0). Our hex map 'imageHex[]' contains an array of hex values where each bit coresponds to a pixel in our display (i.e. bit 0 of imageHex[0] would be pixel 0). With this in mind we simply need a way to iterate through the each hex value, then iterate though each bit of that byte. We then map this bit to it's coresponding row and column of our OLED screen. Finally calling display_draw() updates tehe screen with the screen.</p>

	Part 3: Scrolling the image

<p>Now lets get out image to repeadly scoll down the screen. If you were able to follow what we did above then good news, this part is a little easier. All we have to do now is increment the </p>
